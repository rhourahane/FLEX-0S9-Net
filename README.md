# FLEX-0S9-Net
This a copy of the code from http://www.swtpcemu.com/swtpc/downloads/FLEX-OS9-Net.zip.

I have updated the code for the following
- Bring code more inline with C# coding style.
- Remove commented out console interaction code
- Use threads rather than busy waiting
- Upgrade to .NET 6
- Allow config file to be specified on command line
- Use JSON config files and standard config libraries
- Allow specifying com device to allow running on Linux
