# FLEX-0S9-Net
This is a copy of the code from http://www.evenson-consulting.com/swtpc/downloads/FLEX-OS9-Net.zip 

I'm building it with VisualStudio 2022 (Version 17.7.3) so I can use it with my Microbox 2K2 computer. I intend to clean up the code and possibly give it a GUI but none of this might happen.
